## How to build

Before building, make sure you have python>=3.9 and MySQL installed and configured. Also, It is recommended to build inside separate virtual environment:
1. Clone repository (`git clone https://github.com/feelofgoodvibes/statok`)
2. Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install .`)
3. Set global environment variables `MYSQL_USER` and `MYSQL_PASS` (username and password for MySQL)
4. Create database `statok_db` (`CREATE DATABASE statok_db` via mysql-shell)
5. Change working directory to `statok_app` (`cd statok_app`). Apply migrations to database schema:
    - `flask db upgrade +1` - to create only database tables
    - `flask db upgrade` - to create database tables and populate them with test data
6. Go back to project root directory (`cd ..`)
7. Run application: `gunicorn "statok_app.app:create_app()"`

**ðŸŽ‰ App is up and running!**
It is available at the address and port specified in the `gunicorn.conf.py` configuration file (by default `http://localhost:5000`)
